The Video Facial Animation python code still only processes a single image of the .mp4 video file, but I imagine it could be batched like in Adrian's example code to 
analyze multiple images. It may take a ton of RAM though so I was scared to try. 

To install the face alignment software, you can enter the following into your console with
either pip of conda:

conda install -c 1adrianb face_alignment
or
pip install face-alignment
